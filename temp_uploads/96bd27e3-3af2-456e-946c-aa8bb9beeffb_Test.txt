🌙 The Lost Key

On a quiet evening in Willow Town, 12-year-old Arjun found a small silver key while playing near the old banyan tree. It shimmered even in the fading sunlight. Curious, he pocketed it and ran home.

That night, as he placed the key on his table, it began to glow softly. A faint whisper filled the room — “Find the door that listens.”

Arjun couldn’t sleep. The next morning, he searched the town — every gate, every cupboard, every lock. Nothing fit. Finally, he returned to the banyan tree, disappointed.

Then, he heard a creaking sound. The bark of the tree had a small keyhole he had never noticed before. Heart racing, he inserted the key.

With a click, the trunk opened to reveal a staircase spiraling down into golden light. Arjun took a deep breath and stepped in — and the door closed behind him, leaving only the echo of his laughter and the whisper, “Welcome, Guardian of Secrets.”
